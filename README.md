We're building a <b>network of available workspaces</b> near every remote worker in big cities.

Opening workspaces at peoples'houses will open a <b>gigantic new network of possibilities</b>.

The app allows remote workers to either <b>choose a workspace</b> where to spend the day - it is also possible to book in advance, or to <b>offer their own workspace</b>.

We're also helping remote workers to get together and <b>exchange advice and share skills</b>.
